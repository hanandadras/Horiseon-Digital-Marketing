# Code Refactor Starter Code
This Readme.md file is for Horiseon-Digital-Marketing, a company working in the field of SEO, Online reputation management and social media marketing
The html had a change in the <h1> title to include the company's name Horiseon, instead of Hori.
The id="search-engine-optimization" was added to make the link interactive.
The div was replaced with section tag in the html document because it is a semantic element.
The CSS was refactored to regroup different classes that have the same properties.
